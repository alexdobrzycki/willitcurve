**Will it Curve?** 

Oftentimes I hear people asking whether or not a professor is going to curve a class.

Will it Curve? is a web application I decided to make for fun that answers this question, by estimating the curve a professor could give.

It utilizes PlanetTerp’s API to retrieve grade data based on the user’s input.

Example: If you're taking CMSC216 and you believe your class' average is a 65, enter "CMSC216" and "65" into the input boxes. 

The output is an approximation of a curve that the professor could grant based on real UMD historical grade data.
